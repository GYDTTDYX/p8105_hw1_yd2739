## Problem 1
```{r}
library("moderndive")
data("early_january_weather")
variables = colnames(early_january_weather)
observation_num = nrow(early_january_weather)
variable_num = ncol(early_january_weather)
mean_temp = mean(early_january_weather$temp)
q1_scatter = ggplot(data = early_january_weather, 
       mapping = aes(x = time_hour, 
                y = temp, 
                color = humid)) + 
  geom_point()
ggsave(
  'problem_1_scatter.png',
  plot = q1_scatter,
  device = png
)
q1_scatter
```
the variables in the dataset are: `r variables`. 

the size of the data is `r observation_num` x `r variable_num`. 

the mean temperature is `r mean_temp` degree.
